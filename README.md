# inputBuilder
Easy to build and style custom select, checkbox and radio inputs

This is currently a crude system to quickly and easily build styleable input elements such as `select` `checkbox` and `radio` elements.

Currently this project is still in pre-release as I have a lot of features I plan on adding in. Some of which being, the ability to point `inputBuilder` to an input element that already exists and it will be redone to be styleable. I also would like to add in the ability to handle `select` `option` elements more intuitively after build. Such as the ability to add in new options or easily update the labels or order of the options.
